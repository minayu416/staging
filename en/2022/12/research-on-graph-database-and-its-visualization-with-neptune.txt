8:T4b25,<p>Amazon Neptune Graph Database and Data Visualization is the topic we want to research in this cross-ream collaboration in our company.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We have a special scrum sprint called Innovative Idea Research every 3 months in our company, in this sprint, software engineers can choose the topics they have interesting to do research and show the result in last demo day.</p>
<p>The company proposed the new rule allows us can collaborate with members from other team on same research for improving the cross-team communication and increase the research diversity.</p>
<p>I saw many different cards on the board and there is a interesting name on one card.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neptune this name looks very cool, then "Visualization" might represent there will be some front-end skill included. I learned front-end since this year April and have some interesting with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I filled my name on the card, then we begin the collaboration with 1 member from another team and 1 member in same team but haven't had collaboration before.</p>
<p>I like this experience, it look like I leave the comfortable zone, and have more new experience with cross-team collaboration and new technology. I would like to extract some content from our original research note to here.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our research topic is <code>Research on Amazon Neptune and Data Visualization</code>.</p>
<p>This AWS service has been used for long while in the member who from another team, but me and my team member, we have 0 experience for it, and we need to learn even graph database and both AWS Neptune service in 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>The table of content as following:</p>

<h2>Basic Knowledge</h2>
<p>The following concepts can help you roughly understand Graph Database.</p>
<ul>
<li>NoSQL</li>
<li>Nodes, Edges, Label, Properties</li>
<li>Query Language</li>
<li>Relational Database(RDB) VS Graph Database(Graph DB)</li>
</ul>
<h3>NOSQL</h3>
<p>Graph Database is a NoSQL database, unlike relational database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, they are different and not each service suit the Relational Database(RDBMS).</p>
<p>|     | Type  | Example  |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| NoSQL  | Key-Value | Redis |
|              | Document-based | MongoDB |
|              | Column-based | BigTable |
|              | Graph-based | Neptune, Neo4j |
| RDBMS | Table-based | MySQL, PostgreSQL |</p>
<p>Through the above table, we can know the Graph DB is one of NoSQL DB.</p>
<h3>Nodes, Edges, Label and Property</h3>
<p>Then we introduce the concepts of how Graph DB save data. If the nouns in RDB are Table, Column, Primery Key and Foreign Key，then in Graph DB there are Nodes, Edges, Label 和 Property.</p>
<p>| Object | Description |
|  ----  | ----  |
| Nodes  | Represent entities like company, people, account, this is roughly the equivalent of a record or row in relational database. |
| Edges | Like the relationship or connection between nodes, this is the key concept in graph database. |
| Label | Attribute that group similar nodes together, for example different company nodes belong to <strong>Label Company</strong>, like Google, Tesla, Apple, they are different <strong>Nodes</strong> but belong to <strong>Label called Company</strong>. so you can use like <em><strong>g.V().hasLabel("Company")</strong></em> to get all company Nodes. |
| Properties | Such as the properties which nodes or edges have, for example, if one company is a node, there might have employees count, founded date or location properties. Also, you can add property in Edge.|</p>
<p>Graph Database is more suitable for the data have highly complicated relationship.</p>
<h3>Query Langauge: Gremlin</h3>
<p>The relation of Query language and Database like SQL and MySQL. In Graph DB, there are many query language, like Gremlin, Cypher, GQL, SPARQL, PGQL, GraphQL.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<p>| Query Language | Statement  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| SQL  | SELECT * FROM table_name |
| Gremlin  | g.V().hasLabel(label_name) |</p>
<p>In this research, we learn Gremlin and use it on AWS Neptune and Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>The following is the Cheat Sheet</p>
<pre><code class="language-Gremlin">%%Gremlin

// list all Nodes
g.V()

// list Nodes with limit 25 records
g.V().limit(25)

// list all Edges
g.E()

// list all Nodes and its value
g.V().valueMap()

// list all Nodes with its ID and its value
g.V().valueMap(true)

// list all Edges and its value
g.E().valueMap(true)

// Delete all Nodes &#x3C;-- This dangerous query must teach haha, careful to use.
g.V().drop().iterate()

// Delete all Edges 
g.E().drop().iterate()

// Add one Node
g.V().add("Company")

// Add one Node and its Property
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0001").property("name", "Innova").as("COM-0001")
g.V().add("Employee").property(id, "EMP-0001").property("name", "Mina").as("EMP-0001")

// Add Edge and Property (fill with Node Id)/and addE(the name of relationship): connect employee -> company
g.V("EMP-0001").addE("belong").to(__.V("COM-0001")).property("checkIn", "2022-02-14")

// Add data continuously: only the last query don't need to put next()
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0001").property("name", "Innova").as("COM-0001").next()
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0002").property("name", "Google").as("COM-0002").next()
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0003").property("name", "Tesla").as("COM-0003")

// Query same Label Node
g.V().hasLabel("Company")

// Query specific ID Node/Edge
g.V("COM-0001")
g.E("&#x3C;id>")

<h3>Relational Database(RDB) VS Graph Database(Graph DB)</h3>
<p>|  | Graph DataBase | Relational Database  |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| Format  | Nodes, Edges | Tables with Rows and Columns |
| Relationship | Considered data, represented by edges between nodes | Related across tables, established using foreign keys between tables.
| Complex Query | Run quickly and do not require joins | Require complex joins between tables |
| Top Use Case | Relationship-heavy use cases, including fraud detection and recommendation engines. Highly-connected data that comes with an intrinsic need for relationship analysis. Data model is inconsistent and demands frequent changes. | Transaction-focused use cases, including online transactions and accounting. |
| Example  | <img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-14-at-11.14.47-am.png" alt=""> | <img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-14-at-11.15.00-am.png" alt=""> |
| Pros  | Addtional attribute could be added at some point. Not all entities will have all the attribute in the table. The attribute types are not strictly defined. | it is faster when handling huge numbers of records because the structure of the data is known ahead of time. Relational database in tables with rows and columns and uses <code>JOIN</code> for fast querying. |
| Cons  | Run frequent table scans and searches for data that fits defined categories. When you have a known key and need to retrieve the data associated with it, a graph database is not particularly useful. If the entities in your model have very large attributes like BLOBs, CLOBs, long texts... then graph databases aren't the best solution. | Relational databases are slower for large datasets. Relational database has poor performance for deep analytics. |</p>

<h2>Implementation Part</h2>
<p>After learn concepts, we need to do some exercise, there will be 3 parts inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Amazon Neptune Database + Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Use Gremlin to operate data</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>That's GO!</p>
<h3>Create Amazon Neptune Database + Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p>I'm not sure everyone want to use Amazon Neptune Database, because for me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is little expensive :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At begining, I think I created a new AWS account and use the Free Tier Plan will not be charged, but I still be charged 40 USD in 2 months (acutaully I played it 2 weeks, but cross November and December.).</p>
<p>So weird, in second time, I only created Neptune Database, I haven't use it in few mins and I got charged again haha.</p>
<p>(40 USD in my country is expensive.)</p>
<p>I use the AWS console to create Neptune, not the AWS CLI, not the Terraform. So that's do it.</p>
<p>Enter your cute Amazon Dashoboard and type Neptune on Search Bar for entering Neptune.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.51.12-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.51.39-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click three dots at the left side.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.53.20-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.53.30-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click Database and click Create database.</p>
<p>In the setting part, be careful the Free Plan in AWS Neptune is the Engine options <code>Provisioned</code> + <code>db.t3.medium</code></p>
<p>Please check your region, make sure your region supports Neptune instance.</p>
<p>If you got Failed, please check in CloudWatch.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you got same error, it might represent your region doesn't support the instance <code>db.t3.medium</code> , we can created DB in region <code>us-east-1</code>。</p>
<p>In Create database setting, <code>Engine options</code> please choose <code>Provisioned</code>, I tried <code>Serverless</code>, it is not belong to Free Plan scope.</p>
<p><code>Templates</code> choose <code>Development and Testing</code>，<code>DB instance size</code> choose <code>Buerstable classes</code>: <code>db.t3.medium</code>。</p>
<p><code>Connectivity</code> is more complex part, it has permission problem and need to research the VPC part, I use the root user, so I have all permission, I suggest to call the helping from the MIS or DevOps, help to create Neptune Database directly.</p>
<p><code>Notebook configuration</code>，We need Jupyter Notebook to connect to Neptune and query data with it. so turn on the Create notebook.</p>
<p>After created, it will take some time to create DB and Notebook, you can check jupyter Notebook in Notebook section.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-10.12.15-pm.png" alt="">
<img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-10.12.24-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why the screenshot I provided is serverless? Because I told my company that I use my account to do research and be charged xD, they provide this Neptune for me to playing, so the Operator help me to create the Neptune directly, because I don't have permission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember stop the DB and Notebook when you don't use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Use Gremlin to do simple operation</h3>
<p>Next step, please open the Notebook，we will use Gremlin to put some data.</p>
<p>First, that us check the database.</p>
<pre><code>// Remember put this in AWS Jupyter Notebook, mark the next query need to use Gremlin to run 
%%gremlin

// list all Nodes
g.V()
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.16.24-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Because I have put some data inside it, or the database should empty if just created.</p>
<p>That's add some data, we add 2 Nodes.</p>
<pre><code>%%gremlin

g.addV("People").
     property(id,"PPL-0001").
     property("name","Amy").
     property("age",29).
     property("gender","F",).
     property("job","Engineer").
     as("PPL-0001").next()

g.addV("People").
     property(id,"PPL-0002").
     property("name","Jason").
     property("age", 31).
     property("gender","M",).
     property("job","Salesmen").
     as("PPL-0002")

</code></pre>
<p>Now, we have 2 Nodes (2 People) belong to Label People, there are Properties id, name, gender and job, Amy and Jason.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.29.25-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then use <code>g.V()</code> to lise all Node, you can see the id PPL-0001 and PPL-0002 are the Nodes we just inserted.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.29.47-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then if you want to see the properties.</p>
<pre><code>g.V().valueMap(true)
</code></pre>
<p>List all Nodes and its properties.</p>
<p>Then, we are gonna to add spme relationship by using Edge.</p>
<p>I want to present that Amy lile Jason since 2022/8</p>
<pre><code>%%gremlin

// PPL-0001 Amy add one Edge like -> PPL-0002 Jason
g.V('PPL-0001').addE('like').to(__.V('PPL-0002'))

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.31.13-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see the Edge now.</p>
<p>So now we have 2 Nodes and 1 Edge.</p>
<ul>
<li>PPL-0001</li>
<li>PPL-0002</li>
<li>PPL-0001-like->PPL-0002</li>
</ul>
<p>But now each data present by words, it's hard to see, so now we are gonna to introduce Data Visualization.</p>
<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<p>In our research, we took the research on three methods for Data Visualization of Graph Database, 2 of them are tools and not really need to install DB, so if you want to play Graph DB and Gremlin, here will introduce 2 methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook">aws/graph-notebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gdotv.com/">G.V()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gremlify.com/">Gremlify</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>aws/graph-notebook</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook">aws/graph-notebook</a> is a Python Package used in Jupyter Notebook, we use this in our implementation part. It has been included in Jupyter Notebook when created.</p>
<p>We researched one query sentence can show the data by graph.</p>
<pre><code>%%gremlin -p v,ine,outv,oute,inv
g.V().or(hasLabel("&#x3C;Label1>"), hasLabel("&#x3C;Label2>"))
     .inE().outV()
     .outE().inV().path().by(valueMap(true))

</code></pre>
<p>Use this query and then fill up the Label data you want to show, you can touch it.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.32.25-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.32.39-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, this is the data we just inserted, you can see the properties by press the three line icon.</p>
<p>If you want to find key words in any Nodes or Edges, you can use the search bar, like the screenshot showed.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.33.09-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>About the data visualization, I didn't put many data in the above description, so can not show more, let me show some mock data in our research, these all are mock data, will not involve our company.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.34.26-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We use same query but with different Label name which the data I have inserted before.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.34.39-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, I think the naming of Edges is not good, it looks little mess haha.</p>
<p>Use search bar to search key words will show the related Nodes and Edges.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.36.02-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So that's all the content about using <code>aws/graph-notebook</code>.</p>
<h4>G.V()</h4>
<p>That's introduce <a href="https://gdotv.com/">G.V()</a> which provided by AWS, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/notebooks-visualization-tools.html">the third-party software</a> to realize the data visualization.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.49.43-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is downloaded to the local in computer and includes the version Windows/Mac/Linux.</p>
<p>This software likes the MySQL WorkBrach, it allows we create a playground without any connection with any DB and then we can play Gremlin and GraphDB inside this playground.</p>
<p>There is always a button can show the graph when you do query, so it is very easy and convenient.</p>
<p>However, we stopped the research, because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want to connect to DB, it needs Pro version, which means we need to pay, we don't have budget to buy, and we would like to connect Neptune originally not only play win playground feature.</li>
<li>I found after addE, the existing all Nodes will disappear, I'm not sure the bugs, this will increase more resarch time, due to the time limitation, we stopped the research.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Gremlify</h4>
<p>The finall tool is website, don't need to install and it is free, if you don't have requirement to install DB and just want to try, you can use this. -> <a href="https://gremlify.com/">Gremlify</a>，I haven't use it, but I saw our another member showed this, and seems very convenient.</p>
<p>I don't have screenshot can show, this website allows you use mouse to create Node and Edge directly and not need to write query sentence, I think this is more convenient, and it also have visualization graph when you do query.</p>
<p>If anyone use it and feel good, please leave comment to me, thankt you!</p>
<p>Alright, that's all the research note of our cross-team collaboration Innovative Idea Research. This time I collaborate with 1 member from another team and 1 member who is same team with me but neven collaborate before (she is QE, and we run pair programming), and this technology is totally new for us, this is a very good experience for me, so I would like to write it down.</p>
<p>Espicially when collaborating, we know the member from another team will leave company after 1 month, this will be the first time and also final time we have collaboration, we should hold this opptunity to perform well, to do great job and create good memory and present good result in final.</p>
<p>This is my first time to write English article after a long while, I believe my English improved a lot since I'm working in a Indian company located in Taiwan and having American business collaboration teams.</p>
<p>If you like or if there are some question/some errors in this article, please leave comment or send mail to me, thanks :).</p>
9:T3f19,<p>We have a lengthy security detection flow need to pass before each time we have new release to production, in the part of this flow, there are Black Duck and Fortify On Demand scans.</p>
<p>In this article, I would like to record the research of how to use the APIs of both scans to achieve our automation solution.</p>
<p>This research was conducted for <a href="/en/2023/12/design-innovative-solutions-on-automating-product-release-flow/">this automation solution</a>, if you have interest you can visit it, these 2 articles don't have dependency, so you can only read this article.</p>
<p><em><strong>Notice, we don't record all API endpoints here, only write the APIs which achieved our solutions, if you want to research more, please go to official Black Duck and Fortify On Demand document.</strong></em></p>
<p>When I was researching how to use both scans APIs, I found there were less reference and articles, so I hope this article can help you.</p>

<p>Fortify On Demand (FoD), it has the public <a href="https://api.ams.fortify.com/swagger/ui/index">official Swagger document</a>, offers many APIs and the convenient feature is using swagger to test the API endpoint, so if you get many Errors from response, you can try swagger UI first.</p>
<p>Here is the API Endpoints I want to introduce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oauth Authentication: <code>https://api.ams.fortify.com/oauth/token</code></li>
<li>Get Application: <code>https://api.ams.fortify.com/api/v3/application</code></li>
<li>Get Release (with filter): <code>https://api.ams.fortify.com/api/v3/release</code> or <code>https://api.ams.fortify.com/api/v3/application/&#x3C;application_id>/release</code></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Oauth Authentication</strong></h3>
<p>Before request other FoD APIs, you need to request this Oauth API for getting authorized token, then request other API with this returned token.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// POST https://api.ams.fortify.com/oauth/token
// Header
{
    "scope": "api-tenant", // visit setting to check scope
    "grant_type": "password", 
    "username": "&#x3C;tenant>\\&#x3C;user_name>", // check tenant and user name in settings and make sure \ and \\. 
    // Correct: &#x3C;tenant>\&#x3C;user_name>.
    "password": "&#x3C;personal_token>" // This is not fill your password, this fill the token you generate in FoD settings.
}

</code></pre>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "access_token": "ZGHJ3274JDK" // You will get authorized token, this is only example.
}
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Get Application</strong></h3>
<p>After you got authorized token, we can request other APIs with this token. First, get all application.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// GET https://api.ams.fortify.com/api/v3/application
// Header
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json", 
    "Accept": "application/json", 
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;token>", // With header, attach the token you got from Oauth response.
}

</code></pre>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    ...,
    "items": [{
        "applicationName": "",
        "applicationId": "",
        ...
    }, {
        ...
    }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Through this API, you will get many Application, you can know the applicationName, applicationId and related information.</p>
<p>This API support filter, you can find the application you want, I will introduce it in next API, the usage of filter is similiar cross APIs.</p>
<h3><strong>Get Release (with filter)</strong></h3>
<p>You can pick to get release or release belongs with specific application, the second API, you need to bring applicationId.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// GET https://api.ams.fortify.com/api/v3/release or https://api.ams.fortify.com/api/v3/application/&#x3C;application_id>/release
// Header
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json", 
    "Accept": "application/json", 
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;token>", // With header, attach the token you got from Oauth response.
}

// Params -> Notice: this is Parameters, not Body, here is GET method, you need to put it in parameters. In Python, please put requests.get(params=&#x3C;params>). In postman, please put Params.
{
    "filter": "ReleaseName:&#x3C;service_name>" // Here is single filter example, if you have multiple condition, please use + connect with them. &#x3C;condition1>:&#x3C;value1>+&#x3C;condition2>:&#x3C;value2>
}

</code></pre>
<p>The format of filter is <code>&#x3C;filter field1>:&#x3C;filter value1>+&#x3C;filter field2>:&#x3C;filter value2></code>, so if I want to filter <code>ReleaseName</code> is <code>ppt-scanner</code> then I put</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"filter": "ReleaseName:ppt-scanner"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The official document doesn't record detailed possible filter fields, you can observe the properties in API response and try filter with properties.</p>
<h2>Black Duck (BD)</h2>
<p>Black Duck scan (BD), the official document is private, you can go the the <code>?</code> -> <code>REST API Developer Guide</code> in the Black Duck service right top side panel, the document is very clear.</p>
<p>In this article, I will introduce the following API endpoint, please instead <code>host_name</code> to your server host name.</p>
<ul>
<li>Authentication: <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/tokens/authenticate</code></li>
<li>Query project: <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects</code></li>
<li>Get version: <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions</code></li>
<li>Generate Version Details Report: <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/reports</code></li>
<li>Download Version Details Report: <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/reports/&#x3C;report_id>/download</code></li>
<li>Visit components with filter: <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/components</code></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Authentication</strong></h3>
<p>Similiar with above FoD scan, you need to request Authentication endpoint to get authorized Bearer token and use it for requesting other APIs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// POST https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/tokens/authenticate
// Header
{
    "Accept": "application/vnd.blackducksoftware.user-4+json", 
    "Authorization": "token &#x3C;personal_token>", // You can get the personal_token in Black Duck website -> the setting -> Access token -> generate personal token, if you need to generate report, you need to open the write permission.
    // Authorization value, please put "token" before your personal token, I stuck here much time. example: "Authorization": "token GH2395JKls=="
}

</code></pre>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "bearerToken": "ZGHJ3274JDK" // After requested, you get find the returned bearerToken if status 200.
}
</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Query project</strong></h3>
<p>After we got the bearerToken, we can request other APIs. first. we want to get projects with filter (or just get all projects)</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// GET https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects
// Header
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;bearerToken>", // Put the authorized bearerToken here.
}
// Params -> Yeah, its Parameters, this is GET method, so don;t put in body, doesn't work.
// If you need limit or filter with project, then you need this parameters.
{
    "limit": 5, // Only get 5 records
    "q": "name:&#x3C;filter_name>" // Yeah, filter key just a q, and put &#x3C;filter field>:&#x3C;filter value>, not sure filter with other properties, you can check properties in response.
}
</code></pre>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    ...,
    "items": [{
        "name": "",
        "_meta": {
            "href": ""
        },
        ...
    }, {
        ...
    }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>And I found, the project information in response doesn't include <code>project_id</code>, so I found <code>project_id</code> by split the url in <code>item[_meta][href]</code>, then <code>split("/")[-1]</code> split the href to get the last segment, it is <code>project_id</code>.</p>
<h3><strong>Get version</strong></h3>
<p>After you got the project_id, now we would like to get all versions under this project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// GET https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions
// Header
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;bearerToken>", // Put authorized BearerToken
}

</code></pre>
<p>Remember to put the project_id in request url.</p>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "items": [{
        "versionName": "master",
        ...,
        "_meta": {
            "href": ""
        },
    },
    {
        "versionName": "version_1",
        ...,
        "_meta": {
            "href": ""
        },
    }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yeah, it doesn't return <code>version_id</code>, so we need to split by <code>item[_meta][href]</code> with <code>split("/")[-1]</code> to get <code>version_id</code></p>
<p>The _meta.href will like <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions/&#x3C;version_id></code>, so split by "/" then get the last segment then you will get version_id.</p>
<h3><strong>Generate Version Details Report</strong></h3>
<p>So now we have <code>project_id</code> and <code>version_id</code>, we can generate Version Detail report based on it.</p>
<p>If you want to generate other type reports, please refer the official website.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// POST https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/reports
// Yes, we don't need to put project_id, its little weird.
// Header
{
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;bearerToken>", // Put the authorized bearerToken
}

// Body -> this is Body, because of the POST method.
{
    "reportFormat": "CSV", // here we put CSV, but there is JSON format can choose.
    "reportType": "VERSION",
    "caregories": ["VERSION", "COMPONENTS", "SECURITY", "PROJECT_VERSION_CUSTOM_FIELDS"] // You can check what categories you need when you generate reports in website then fill in here.
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not sure the part of categories, you can generate a report in website and open the <code>Developer Tool -> Network</code> then click generate, the developer tool will show the request and response, you can check the value of Header and Body in it.</p>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    "links": {
        "download": {
            "url"
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can through <code>links</code> -> <code>download</code> -> <code>url</code> to get <code>report_id</code>.</p>
<p>And again, using split to get the last segment of url (<code>split("/")[-1]</code>), that is the <code>report_id</code></p>
<p>Maybe there are other ways to get <code>project_id, version_id and report_id</code>, but I didn't get it.</p>
<h3><strong>Download Version Details Report</strong></h3>
<p>After generated report, it doesn't finish immediately, so if you write program to do automation, you can write while loop and pending 7-10 seconds. (It will finish at 30 seconds)</p>
<p>If the report haven't done, it will return HTTP status 412, but if raise other errors, it will also return 412, so need to check message in response.</p>
<p>Here is the request for downloading the report.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// GET https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/reports/&#x3C;report_id>/download
// Weird again, we don't need project_id to generate report, but need it when download report.
// Header
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;bearerToken>", // Put authorized bearerToken.
}

</code></pre>
<p>The response content is bytes, here is the python code to download it, in python 3.9.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># If download at local computer
import io
import zipfile

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content))
    z.extractall("./")

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-py"># If you want to save into AWS S3 bucket. 
import io
import boto3
import zipfile

s3_client = boto3.client("s3")

s3_bucket = "&#x3C;bucket_name>"

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
if response.status_code == 200:
    z = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(response.content))
    for file_info in z.infolist():
        file_name = file_info.filename

        # Read file content
        file_content = z.read(file_name)

        save_key = f"&#x3C;prefix>/{file_name}"

        # Upload content to S3
        s3_client.upload_fileobj(io.BytesIO(file_content), s3_bucket, save_key)

</code></pre>
<h3><strong>Visit components with filter</strong></h3>
<p>The last one, I want to introduce visit components with specific <code>project_id</code> and <code>version_id</code>.</p>
<p>In this API, we can add many filters, but I only add one.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// GET https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/components
// Fill the project_id and version_id

// Header
{
    "Authorization": "Bearer &#x3C;bearerToken>", // Put bearerToken
}

// Params -> Parameters, because GET method, not Body.
{
    "limit": 10, // limit 10 or the number you can set.
    "filter": "bomPolicy:in_violation" // filter -> field_key: field_option
}

</code></pre>
<p>Here, I tried to get any In violation components.</p>
<p>response</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// If there is not match in filter, it will return [] in items.
{
    "items": [{
        "componentName": "",
        "componentVersionName": ""
    },
    {
        "componentName": "",
        "componentVersionName": ""
    }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, you can put filters in <code>Params</code> to filter components.</p>
<p>If you are not sure how to write filter content, you can visit the Black Duck website, enter the components page -> open Develoepr Tool -> Network, then you add any filter, you can see the Network catch the request and response, you can read the Parameters in Network.</p>
<p>Or get infromation in the url <code>https://&#x3C;host_name>/api/projects/&#x3C;project_id>/versions/&#x3C;version_id>/components?filter=bomPolicy:in_violation</code>, the filters information is after <code>?filter=</code> words and you can try in Params with Python or Postman.</p>
<p>Alright, these are the research and introduction of Fortify On Demand and Black Duck APIs.</p>
<p>Hope this help you and thanks for reading.</p>
a:T31d2,<p>This automation solutions was my research for the last half year of my time at this company.</p>
<p>We have a lengthy security detection flow which needs to pass each time when there is new feature wants to release on production. The average time of passing this flow is approximately 3 weeks to 1 month, as soon as 2 weeks and the slowest is more than a month.</p>
<p>To complete this flow, we need at first product manager provide detailed information of new/fix feature and prodocu when submitting the release request, then the information will be reviewed by security department, some times need to several meeting calls or comments to ensure the correctness of information.</p>
<p>Then we need engineers to help do scans on each related micro-service manually and provide the evidence of the scan result.</p>
<p>I remember one time we finished 5 features development and all release schedules were slow because of the stuck of the flow.</p>
<p>Since the June of this year (2023), we were committed to research the flow, design and propose the solutions to automate the part of doing scans. We developed the program, helped our team and US team and propose this solution to cross-orgnization teams.</p>
<p>Thanks for the supports from the company, team and my colleagues, they supported us to research and achieve many innovative solutions during this work period.</p>
<p>Here is the research.</p>
<h2>Table of Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>Research the whole flow and found the possibility automating steps.</li>

<h2>Research the whole flow and found the possibility automating steps.</h2>
<p>We clarified the whole flow by interviewed our product manager, Engineers and QA Engineers.</p>
<p>This is the whole flow and I removed sensitive information.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-05-at-9.30.32e280afpm-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Release Request Flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit the Release Request by creating a Jira Ticket
<ul>
<li>Create a Jira Ticket</li>
<li>Fill Up required information</li>
<li>Submit for Review</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review
<ul>
<li>Review the release content on Jira
<ul>
<li>If information is incorrect, return for revising.</li>
<li>If correct, open the Security Detection Ticket.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Security Detection Request
<ul>
<li>Black Duck Scan
<ul>
<li>Generate and download report for each micro-service</li>
<li>Check and prove there is not In violation in micro-service by screenshot.</li>
<li>Package reports and screenshot as attachment and upload to Jira.</li>
<li>Prepare for review.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fortify On Demand Scan
<ul>
<li>Scan each micro-service or check the last scanning date not over 30 days.</li>
<li>Gather the result links and update to Jira.</li>
<li>Prepare for review</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>... (At least 3 scans, max 5.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During the whole flow, there are possibilities to cost many days on the request returning and revising.</p>
<p>After clarified the whole flow, we found the possible automating steps in following list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create/Clone Release Request Jira Ticket -> Jira API
<ul>
<li>Clone previous Jira Ticket, avoid the manual inputting error.</li>
<li>Create new ticket and paste the cloned content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check the status of ticket -> Jira API
<ul>
<li>Check the status changes of ticket for the next steps.</li>
<li>Check any new comment (Need to take action on revising)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automating Black Duck Scan -> Selenium + Jira API Upload attachment</li>
<li>Automating Fortify On Demand Scan -> Selenium + Jira API Update links to comment</li>
<li>Check any status changes or new comment on Ticket and notify success message to user for deploy features to production. -> Jira API + Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we chosen to develop program and automated the Black Duck Scan and Fortify On Demand Scan.</p>
<h2>The system design of the first program.</h2>
<p>We decided to develop a python script run locally and automating the the Black Duck Scan and Fortify On Demand scans by Selenium, upload/update the reports to Jira Ticket by Jira APIs.</p>
<p>Here is the diagram.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-05-at-7.15.03e280afpm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We designed 2 ways for inputting the micro-services list which need to scan.</p>
<p>In our team, we have a standardized document format to record each release information, so the first way is inputting the URL of the document and script will crawl the services list from it.</p>
<p>However, we considered there is not each team uses this format, so we designed the second way which is inputting required scan service list manually.</p>
<p>After getting the service list, the script will automate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortify On Demand scan (trigger Selenium open Chrome to do scan)</li>
<li>Update the gathered result links to Jira comment by using Jira APIs.</li>
<li>Black Duck scan (trigger Selenium open Chrome to do scan)</li>
<li>Upload the packaged reports and screenshots as attachment to specific Jira ticket by Jira APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have interests on how to use Jira APIs, you can refer <a href="/en/2023/07/jira-api-research/">this article</a></p>
<p>By the way, Selenium supported <code>Headless Mode</code>, so once you set the mode and it will run automating at the backgound, so users can do other things and not interrupt by automating.</p>
<p>So here is the first local script version and it helped us to finish many times release request flow.</p>
<h2>Hackathon: version extension - cloud version and local script optimization.</h2>
<p>After the first version script has been used officially, we met the 2 months internal Hackathon in our company, our manager propose us to join the competition and extended the cloud version which we wrote in future work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Future Work: if there is chance in future, I would like to research how to move the automating script to Cloud.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The target of this Hackthon, I want to research and develop the AWS cloud version automating solution. However, we found the difficult point: Authentication which might let us failed in this challenge.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-05-at-7.15.26e280afpm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the normal flow, before we open the scan services of Fortify On Demand (FoD) and Black Duck (BD), we need to pass the series of authentication steps until generate the SAML based on our account and password.</p>
<p>Then we are authorized to visit 2 scan services on website with SAML protocol.</p>
<p>The first version local script can run the automating because before we trigger the script, we have already pass the authentication by ourselves, so website will save the cookie or infomration in localStorage.</p>
<p>If we use cloud version which means, every time when cloud service be ran, everything will initialize and start at 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>We wanted to use AWS ECS to build container and request users pass the authentication manually at first time, but this didn't work.</li>
<li>We tried to think if we can develop an AWS Amplify to get the account and password from users, but this against the security, like a phishing site.</li>
<li>Final, after discussed with other team members, we found we can research the APIs of FoD and BD scans, visit 2 scans webiste directly and skip the authentication.</li>
<li>The conservative option is if the cloud version failed, we can still develop an interface for our local script and submit this to final result.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we planned 3 solutions to research.</p>
<ul>
<li>[Cloud Version] To research if there is other AWS services can help us overcome the authentication and generate the SAML protocol.</li>
<li>[Cloud Version] Research FoD and BD scan APIs, develop AWS lambda services to do automating scans.</li>
<li>[Local Version] Optimizing the original local script, design an new interface for script, so users don't need to face the termincal or open IDE to trigger script.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end of Hackathon, I want to show the result of the second and third solutions.</p>
<p>The first solution was researched by my colleague, so I won't put it here.</p>
<h3><strong>Cloud version - FoD and BD APIs system design</strong></h3>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-03-at-9.44.20e280afpm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So after reseaching the APIs of 2 scans in 2-3 weeks, I have found which APIs can achieve our automating steps.</p>
<p>In system design, I designed an API Endpoint by AWS API Gateway allow user request RESTful API with POST method to trigger Lambda and do automating scans, then save the result in S3 bucket.</p>
<p>However, in the steps of BD scan, there is one step requires to provide the screenshot of the In Violation filter of the scan, Lambda can not achieve it, so we design an addtional script with Selenium to help taking screenshot.</p>
<p>The program list in development.</p>
<ul>
<li>[AWS Lambda] Fortify On Demand Scanner</li>
<li>[AWS Lambda] Black Duck Scanner</li>
<li>[AWS Gateway] RESTful POST api endpoint</li>
<li>[Local Python Script] automating screenshot by Selenium</li>
</ul>
<p>POST Request Body</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">// FoD scan api: /api/v1/fortify-on-demand/
{
  "tenet": "",
  "username": "",
  "token": "",
  "serviceList": []

}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-json">// BD scan api: /api/v1/blackduck/
{
  "token": "",
  "serviceList": []

}
</code></pre>
<p>About the research of APIs of Fortify On Demand and Black Duck, I will write another article.</p>
<h3><strong>Local version - developing a new UI interface for the local python script</strong></h3>
<p>In the local version, we decided to develop a new UI interface for users, so users don't need to use IDE and termincal to triger the original local script.</p>
<p>I considered to connect Python local script more easily, so I planned to use Python GUI package <code>Tkinder</code> to develop the inferface.</p>
<p>The interface I designed by Figma.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-03-at-10.43.10e280afpm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Hompage of the application is choosing the way for inputting the list of services for scanning.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-03-at-10.43.19e280afpm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And designed a log page for showing the logs for dynamic running result, includes success and errors.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/12/screenshot-2023-12-03-at-10.43.32e280afpm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Final, showing the scan result, users can check the result manually before upload the evidence to Jira Ticket.</p>
<p>When developing, we have some consideration, because the second solution of API endpoint has finished, so I was thinking to instead the part of connecting original local script by requesting API of second cloud version. Keep the Selenium part for doing screenshot in the step of BD scan and this can fill a vacancy which lambda can not take screenshot.</p>
<p>Also using request APIs of BD and FoD scans can raise the the stability of the system.</p>
<h2>Optimization of features</h2>
<ul>
<li>We removed update/upload to Jira ticket, because users want to check the result manually before upload automitically to ticket.</li>
<li>Revise broken FoD service name if the name is too long.</li>
<li>Help to gather the BD scan links on the scanned service list.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Final, I finished the second solution which is <code>[Cloud Version] request AWS Gateway RESTful API with POST method to trigger AWS Lambda for automate scans through the APIs of 2 scan services.</code></p>
<p>The third solution, because our team got the official announcement of team disbanded, so we don't have chance to continue our research and don't have time to achieve Hackathon because my last day is early before the end of date of Hackathon, but this still a interesting oppotunity to join the competition.</p>
<p>It's very happy that I finished the final goal - cloud version automating program and handovered to US Team, I researched and developed this automating solution and it is still helping US Team members to handle the scans.</p>
<p>Thank you for your read.</p>
b:T1236,<p>When I'm developing my self software service, there is a background with stars and nights effect.</p>
<p>I thought it is difficult to develop when I was designing the background (I do design and development in same role)</p>
<p>However, it finished with an easy way, so today I would like to share the tips.</p>
<h2>Requirement Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my design of the background by Figma.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-18-at-8.34.34-pm.png" alt="starry-sky-by-figma"></p>
<p>This is a starry night background by using linear-gradient and draw the stars by hands.</p>
<p>Here is the Home Page of the service that I'm developing.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-19-at-12.50.59-am.png" alt="miri-home-page"></p>
<p>Based on this background and I add some elements, then this will be a good divination service. This is the first front-end design of the service that I self-learn by using Figma and Front-end skills.</p>
<p>I got 2 methods to develop it from my colleagues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use CSS to draw each line and points.</li>
<li>Put Image directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the beginning, I thought if only put an image, the front-end will look fake, but seems I was wroung xD.</p>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-18-at-8.34.34-pm.png" alt="starry-sky-by-figma"></p>
<p>So, we are gonna to see the Figma, we need following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use linear-gradient to render night space color in background.</li>
<li>Export the stars to SVG file by using Figma Plugin.</li>
<li>Integrate SVG file and background.</li>
</ol>
<p>So first, we are gonna use linear-gradient to render night scene, here are code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* We use three colors starts from top to bottom and render the night space effect.  */
.wallpaper {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(23, 18, 50), rgba(49, 22, 56), rgba(53, 53, 119));
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;div class="wallpaper">

&#x3C;/div>

</code></pre>
<p>So that can done the good night effect.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-18-at-9.21.00-pm.png" alt="night-effect"></p>
<p>Second, we need to export stars to SVG file by Figma Plugin.</p>
<p>I use a tool called SVG Export, you click your componenets (don't forget to group by them.) and then click the plugin, you can download it as SVG file, we will use it later.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-18-at-9.22.27-pm.png" alt="export-step-of-stars"></p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-18-at-9.23.01-pm.png" alt="export-svg-tool-in-figma"></p>
<p>Third, now we need to integrate them as a background.</p>
<p>I tried to put img tag on div directly, but it will cover other divs, and we can not click other divs. I also use <code>z-index</code>, however in one page, I have a lot of cards with z-index arrangement, it will be a nightmare to adjust each z-index sequences.</p>
<p>So, I use <code>before</code> and <code>relative</code> + <code>absolute</code> to reach our requirement, please see following code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.wallpaper {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(23, 18, 50), rgba(49, 22, 56), rgba(53, 53, 119));
  /* We need to add position: relative, and make SVG file as absolute, so the SVG can be attached on background. */
  position: relative;
}

.wallpaper-color::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  /* Because the SVG Export still transfer some space, so we need some adjustment position to put the SVG to right place. */
  top: -46px;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  /* This is the SVG file we exported by Figma Plugin. */
  background-image: url("./static/stars.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  background-size: contain;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">
&#x3C;div class="wallpaper">

&#x3C;/div>

</code></pre>
<p>Remember adding the <code>position:relative</code> in background and adding <code>position:absolute</code> to your SVG css layer, so that we can achieve the effect we want.</p>

<p>That's the tips I want to share to you!</p>
<p>Because I'm a self-learned Front-end and learning by doing projects, so if you have other good resolution on this topic, please share to me and I will update my post.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
c:Tcb5,<p>Since I'm developing my own product and using a lot of gradient color as background color, as a new Front-end learner, this issue stuck me a while, so I would like to share the solution I found.</p>
<h2>Requirement Introduce</h2>
<p>As the picture shows.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-12-at-9.33.08-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This is one of the page in my product, I used the linear-gradient effect in the square.</p>
<p>Here is my CSS and html code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">    &#x3C;div className='h-32 w-32 rounded-[20px]'>
        &#x3C;div className='h-32 w-32 rounded-[20px] border square'>
        &#x3C;/div>
    &#x3C;/div>

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-css">
.square {
  border-color: #EACB84;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom right, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4), rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2));
}

</code></pre>
<p>In this product, user needs to choose square, so I want to add a new effect to show if user choose the square, as picture shows.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/screenshot-2023-08-12-at-9.33.16-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the begining, I though this is very easy, only use hover and change background color can achieve the requirement. However, I was wrong, it didnt work.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>Since I'm a self-learner of Front-end, I only found this solution, if anyone has better solutions, please share to me, I will update the article.</p>
<p>This is the reason why change backgound color doesn't work:</p>
<p><strong>The priority of using linear-gradient as background color is higher then other simple backgound color, so change background color doesn't work.</strong></p>
<p>The solution I found is using <code>overlay</code> + <code>absolute</code> to resolve the bug. Add a new div in front of the original square div and using absolute to <strong>cover</strong> the background-color of the square div.</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">    &#x3C;!-- Remember to add relative, because we want the overlay div absolute and cover the square div  -->
    &#x3C;div className='relative h-32 w-32 rounded-[20px]'>
        &#x3C;!-- Because I use React.js, so when user choose specific div, this will add the div overlay. -->
        &#x3C;!-- You can change the JS or handle event style according the framework you use. -->
        {selectedDiv === square.id &#x26;&#x26; &#x3C;div className="overlay">&#x3C;/div>}
            &#x3C;div className='h-32 w-32 rounded-[20px] border square'>
            &#x3C;/div>
    &#x3C;/div>

</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-css">.overlay {
  /* position is absolute, cover the background of square div */
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 20px;
  background-color: rgba(234, 203, 132);
  opacity: 0.4; 
}

</code></pre>
<p>And that's done:</p>

<p>This is the issue and solution I faced in product and this stuck me a long while, I'm not sure there is other better solution, if you have any ideas, welcome to share to me, I will update in article.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
d:Te93,<p>Recent, I'm developing my tarot app and it needs to send HTTP requests to back-end API. I face CORS issue several times, but I forgot how to resolve each time, so in this post, I will record the resolution.</p>
<h2>Why &#x26; What is CORS (Cross-origin resource sharing)</h2>
<p>I will only have some shorten introduction of CORS here.</p>
<p>Before CORS, we refer the Same-origin policy first, due to the Information Security, to avoid requests from another domain outside the original domain, because some hackers or third-party software will mock the fake domain and attack your services, so any requests (for example, calling API or any CSS and Images resources need in same domain).</p>
<p>However, in recent technological trend, it's normal that services request outside API and resources, so there is CORS requests happened.</p>
<ol>
<li>My case is Jamstack, my front-end hosted on Github, and my Back-end API hosted on Vercel, when front-end send the request and showed <code>Access to Reqeust, ... has been blocked by CORS policy</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think many developers have faced this CORS issue many times.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Second case is I developed a website and it has operation with Google Firestore &#x26; Firebase, also faced the CORS.</li>
</ol>
<p>I tried many resolution fix in front-end, but it doesn't work, the rresolution in my these 2 cases, is to add white list to allow domain sending request, so in this post, I will show the implementation code.</p>
<h2>Case 1: Front-end React.js with Back-end Python Fask API</h2>
<p>When React.js use fetch method for sending HTTPS Request and Back-end API blocked the request because the CORS.</p>
<p>The resolution is we implemented the CORS in API layer and add the front-end domain into white list, here is the code.</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
# Import fastapi package
from fastapi import FastAPI

# Import fastapi cors feature
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

# (1) Init an app
app = FastAPI()

# (2) put allow domains in white list
origins = [
    "http://localhost",
    "https://example.com"
]

# (3) Init CORS object and put the white list with it
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# (4) Write api route
@app.get("/")
def hello_word():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
</code></pre>
<h2>Case 2: React.js operate data with Google Firestore or Firebase</h2>
<p>This case is when I use React.js and store/get data with Firebase (Firestore/Realtime DB), the domain blocked by Firebase.</p>
<p>So what we need to do is going to Firebase Console and set the allow domains in white list.</p>
<p>First, we go Google Firebase Console and choose your project.</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/screenshot-2023-07-07-at-2.55.25-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then we need to create Authentication for this project (If you have Authentication, you can skip this)</p>
<p>Click All projects -> Select Authentication -> Get started</p>
<p><img src="https://minayu0416.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/screenshot-2023-07-07-at-2.57.39-pm-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After you created Authentication, you can configure allow enter users or Sign-in method in the Users and Sign-in method tabs, but now we go to the Settings tab.</p>
<p>Go to Authentication -> Settings -> Authorized domains -> Add domain, and then add the domains you want to let it allowed without <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.</p>
<p>After added, the services can operate with the Firebase without CORS errors.</p>
<p>That's all for my resolution, if you have quesions, please leave in below Comment section, thank you!</p>

<h2>前言</h2>
<p>In my current company, we have more complex and strict deployment flow for releasing new features in production.</p>
<p>It controlled by Jira Ticket and we need to create new ticket manually for submit a new release request to DevOps Team, they will work on the ticket requirement and request us to provide security scan evidence.</p>
<p>Our product managers hope to automate part of flow, so that's the new research to our team.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Are you ready to go? That's start at Code.</p>
<p>General Settings</p>
<pre><code class="language-py"># Authorization variable
# When send requests to Jira APIs, we need to add Authorization in request Header.
# You can generate a new token in your account settings.
Auth = "Bearer &#x3C;your-token>"

# In each Jira Ticket there is a key represent the ticket, it is not title, we suppose a new ticket key is PX-1996, the real scene, you need to refer your team policy.

10:T4b25,<p>Amazon Neptune Graph Database and Data Visualization is the topic we want to research in this cross-ream collaboration in our company.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We have a special scrum sprint called Innovative Idea Research every 3 months in our company, in this sprint, software engineers can choose the topics they have interesting to do research and show the result in last demo day.</p>
<p>The company proposed the new rule allows us can collaborate with members from other team on same research for improving the cross-team communication and increase the research diversity.</p>
<p>I saw many different cards on the board and there is a interesting name on one card.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neptune this name looks very cool, then "Visualization" might represent there will be some front-end skill included. I learned front-end since this year April and have some interesting with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I filled my name on the card, then we begin the collaboration with 1 member from another team and 1 member in same team but haven't had collaboration before.</p>
<p>I like this experience, it look like I leave the comfortable zone, and have more new experience with cross-team collaboration and new technology. I would like to extract some content from our original research note to here.</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Our research topic is <code>Research on Amazon Neptune and Data Visualization</code>.</p>
<p>This AWS service has been used for long while in the member who from another team, but me and my team member, we have 0 experience for it, and we need to learn even graph database and both AWS Neptune service in 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>The table of content as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn Basic Knowledge of Graph Database
<ul>
<li>NoSQL</li>
<li>Nodes, Edges, Label, Properties</li>
<li>Query Language: Gremlin</li>
<li>Relational Database(RDB) VS Graph Database(Graph DB)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implementation Part
<ul>
<li>Create Amazon Neptune Database + Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Use Gremlin to do simple query</li>
<li>Data Visualization
<ul>
<li>aws/graph-notebook</li>
<li>G.V()</li>
<li>Gremlify</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<h2>Basic Knowledge</h2>
<p>The following concepts can help you roughly understand Graph Database.</p>
<ul>
<li>NoSQL</li>
<li>Nodes, Edges, Label, Properties</li>
<li>Query Language</li>
<li>Relational Database(RDB) VS Graph Database(Graph DB)</li>
</ul>
<h3>NOSQL</h3>
<p>Graph Database is a NoSQL database, unlike relational database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, they are different and not each service suit the Relational Database(RDBMS).</p>
<p>|     | Type  | Example  |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| NoSQL  | Key-Value | Redis |
|              | Document-based | MongoDB |
|              | Column-based | BigTable |
|              | Graph-based | Neptune, Neo4j |
| RDBMS | Table-based | MySQL, PostgreSQL |</p>
<p>Through the above table, we can know the Graph DB is one of NoSQL DB.</p>
<h3>Nodes, Edges, Label and Property</h3>
<p>Then we introduce the concepts of how Graph DB save data. If the nouns in RDB are Table, Column, Primery Key and Foreign Key，then in Graph DB there are Nodes, Edges, Label 和 Property.</p>
<p>| Object | Description |
|  ----  | ----  |
| Nodes  | Represent entities like company, people, account, this is roughly the equivalent of a record or row in relational database. |
| Edges | Like the relationship or connection between nodes, this is the key concept in graph database. |
| Label | Attribute that group similar nodes together, for example different company nodes belong to <strong>Label Company</strong>, like Google, Tesla, Apple, they are different <strong>Nodes</strong> but belong to <strong>Label called Company</strong>. so you can use like <em><strong>g.V().hasLabel("Company")</strong></em> to get all company Nodes. |
| Properties | Such as the properties which nodes or edges have, for example, if one company is a node, there might have employees count, founded date or location properties. Also, you can add property in Edge.|</p>
<p>Graph Database is more suitable for the data have highly complicated relationship.</p>
<h3>Query Langauge: Gremlin</h3>
<p>The relation of Query language and Database like SQL and MySQL. In Graph DB, there are many query language, like Gremlin, Cypher, GQL, SPARQL, PGQL, GraphQL.</p>
<p>Sample:</p>
<p>| Query Language | Statement  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| SQL  | SELECT * FROM table_name |
| Gremlin  | g.V().hasLabel(label_name) |</p>
<p>In this research, we learn Gremlin and use it on AWS Neptune and Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>The following is the Cheat Sheet</p>
<pre><code class="language-Gremlin">%%Gremlin

// list all Nodes
g.V()

// list Nodes with limit 25 records
g.V().limit(25)

// list all Edges
g.E()

// list all Nodes and its value
g.V().valueMap()

// list all Nodes with its ID and its value
g.V().valueMap(true)

// list all Edges and its value
g.E().valueMap(true)

// Delete all Nodes &#x3C;-- This dangerous query must teach haha, careful to use.
g.V().drop().iterate()

// Delete all Edges 
g.E().drop().iterate()

// Add one Node
g.V().add("Company")

// Add one Node and its Property
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0001").property("name", "Innova").as("COM-0001")
g.V().add("Employee").property(id, "EMP-0001").property("name", "Mina").as("EMP-0001")

// Add Edge and Property (fill with Node Id)/and addE(the name of relationship): connect employee -> company
g.V("EMP-0001").addE("belong").to(__.V("COM-0001")).property("checkIn", "2022-02-14")

// Add data continuously: only the last query don't need to put next()
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0001").property("name", "Innova").as("COM-0001").next()
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0002").property("name", "Google").as("COM-0002").next()
g.V().add("Company").property(id, "COM-0003").property("name", "Tesla").as("COM-0003")

// Query same Label Node
g.V().hasLabel("Company")

// Query specific ID Node/Edge
g.V("COM-0001")
g.E("&#x3C;id>")

<h3>Relational Database(RDB) VS Graph Database(Graph DB)</h3>
<p>|  | Graph DataBase | Relational Database  |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| Format  | Nodes, Edges | Tables with Rows and Columns |
| Relationship | Considered data, represented by edges between nodes | Related across tables, established using foreign keys between tables.
| Complex Query | Run quickly and do not require joins | Require complex joins between tables |
| Top Use Case | Relationship-heavy use cases, including fraud detection and recommendation engines. Highly-connected data that comes with an intrinsic need for relationship analysis. Data model is inconsistent and demands frequent changes. | Transaction-focused use cases, including online transactions and accounting. |
| Example  | <img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-14-at-11.14.47-am.png" alt=""> | <img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-14-at-11.15.00-am.png" alt=""> |
| Pros  | Addtional attribute could be added at some point. Not all entities will have all the attribute in the table. The attribute types are not strictly defined. | it is faster when handling huge numbers of records because the structure of the data is known ahead of time. Relational database in tables with rows and columns and uses <code>JOIN</code> for fast querying. |
| Cons  | Run frequent table scans and searches for data that fits defined categories. When you have a known key and need to retrieve the data associated with it, a graph database is not particularly useful. If the entities in your model have very large attributes like BLOBs, CLOBs, long texts... then graph databases aren't the best solution. | Relational databases are slower for large datasets. Relational database has poor performance for deep analytics. |</p>

<h2>Implementation Part</h2>
<p>After learn concepts, we need to do some exercise, there will be 3 parts inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Amazon Neptune Database + Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Use Gremlin to operate data</li>
<li>Data Visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>That's GO!</p>
<h3>Create Amazon Neptune Database + Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<p>I'm not sure everyone want to use Amazon Neptune Database, because for me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is little expensive :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At begining, I think I created a new AWS account and use the Free Tier Plan will not be charged, but I still be charged 40 USD in 2 months (acutaully I played it 2 weeks, but cross November and December.).</p>
<p>So weird, in second time, I only created Neptune Database, I haven't use it in few mins and I got charged again haha.</p>
<p>(40 USD in my country is expensive.)</p>
<p>I use the AWS console to create Neptune, not the AWS CLI, not the Terraform. So that's do it.</p>
<p>Enter your cute Amazon Dashoboard and type Neptune on Search Bar for entering Neptune.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.51.12-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.51.39-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click three dots at the left side.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.53.20-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-9.53.30-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Click Database and click Create database.</p>
<p>In the setting part, be careful the Free Plan in AWS Neptune is the Engine options <code>Provisioned</code> + <code>db.t3.medium</code></p>
<p>Please check your region, make sure your region supports Neptune instance.</p>
<p>If you got Failed, please check in CloudWatch.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/image.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you got same error, it might represent your region doesn't support the instance <code>db.t3.medium</code> , we can created DB in region <code>us-east-1</code>。</p>
<p>In Create database setting, <code>Engine options</code> please choose <code>Provisioned</code>, I tried <code>Serverless</code>, it is not belong to Free Plan scope.</p>
<p><code>Templates</code> choose <code>Development and Testing</code>，<code>DB instance size</code> choose <code>Buerstable classes</code>: <code>db.t3.medium</code>。</p>
<p><code>Connectivity</code> is more complex part, it has permission problem and need to research the VPC part, I use the root user, so I have all permission, I suggest to call the helping from the MIS or DevOps, help to create Neptune Database directly.</p>
<p><code>Notebook configuration</code>，We need Jupyter Notebook to connect to Neptune and query data with it. so turn on the Create notebook.</p>
<p>After created, it will take some time to create DB and Notebook, you can check jupyter Notebook in Notebook section.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-10.12.15-pm.png" alt="">
<img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-15-at-10.12.24-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Why the screenshot I provided is serverless? Because I told my company that I use my account to do research and be charged xD, they provide this Neptune for me to playing, so the Operator help me to create the Neptune directly, because I don't have permission.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember stop the DB and Notebook when you don't use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Use Gremlin to do simple operation</h3>
<p>Next step, please open the Notebook，we will use Gremlin to put some data.</p>
<p>First, that us check the database.</p>
<pre><code>// Remember put this in AWS Jupyter Notebook, mark the next query need to use Gremlin to run 
%%gremlin

// list all Nodes
g.V()
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.16.24-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Because I have put some data inside it, or the database should empty if just created.</p>
<p>That's add some data, we add 2 Nodes.</p>
<pre><code>%%gremlin

g.addV("People").
     property(id,"PPL-0001").
     property("name","Amy").
     property("age",29).
     property("gender","F",).
     property("job","Engineer").
     as("PPL-0001").next()

g.addV("People").
     property(id,"PPL-0002").
     property("name","Jason").
     property("age", 31).
     property("gender","M",).
     property("job","Salesmen").
     as("PPL-0002")

</code></pre>
<p>Now, we have 2 Nodes (2 People) belong to Label People, there are Properties id, name, gender and job, Amy and Jason.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.29.25-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then use <code>g.V()</code> to lise all Node, you can see the id PPL-0001 and PPL-0002 are the Nodes we just inserted.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.29.47-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then if you want to see the properties.</p>
<pre><code>g.V().valueMap(true)
</code></pre>
<p>List all Nodes and its properties.</p>
<p>Then, we are gonna to add spme relationship by using Edge.</p>
<p>I want to present that Amy lile Jason since 2022/8</p>
<pre><code>%%gremlin

// PPL-0001 Amy add one Edge like -> PPL-0002 Jason
g.V('PPL-0001').addE('like').to(__.V('PPL-0002'))

</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.31.13-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We can see the Edge now.</p>
<p>So now we have 2 Nodes and 1 Edge.</p>
<ul>
<li>PPL-0001</li>
<li>PPL-0002</li>
<li>PPL-0001-like->PPL-0002</li>
</ul>
<p>But now each data present by words, it's hard to see, so now we are gonna to introduce Data Visualization.</p>
<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<p>In our research, we took the research on three methods for Data Visualization of Graph Database, 2 of them are tools and not really need to install DB, so if you want to play Graph DB and Gremlin, here will introduce 2 methods.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook">aws/graph-notebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gdotv.com/">G.V()</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gremlify.com/">Gremlify</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>aws/graph-notebook</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/aws/graph-notebook">aws/graph-notebook</a> is a Python Package used in Jupyter Notebook, we use this in our implementation part. It has been included in Jupyter Notebook when created.</p>
<p>We researched one query sentence can show the data by graph.</p>
<pre><code>%%gremlin -p v,ine,outv,oute,inv
g.V().or(hasLabel("&#x3C;Label1>"), hasLabel("&#x3C;Label2>"))
     .inE().outV()
     .outE().inV().path().by(valueMap(true))

</code></pre>
<p>Use this query and then fill up the Label data you want to show, you can touch it.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.32.25-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.32.39-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So, this is the data we just inserted, you can see the properties by press the three line icon.</p>
<p>If you want to find key words in any Nodes or Edges, you can use the search bar, like the screenshot showed.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.33.09-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>About the data visualization, I didn't put many data in the above description, so can not show more, let me show some mock data in our research, these all are mock data, will not involve our company.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.34.26-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We use same query but with different Label name which the data I have inserted before.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.34.39-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Well, I think the naming of Edges is not good, it looks little mess haha.</p>
<p>Use search bar to search key words will show the related Nodes and Edges.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.36.02-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So that's all the content about using <code>aws/graph-notebook</code>.</p>
<h4>G.V()</h4>
<p>That's introduce <a href="https://gdotv.com/">G.V()</a> which provided by AWS, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/notebooks-visualization-tools.html">the third-party software</a> to realize the data visualization.</p>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/screenshot-2022-12-16-at-8.49.43-pm.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is downloaded to the local in computer and includes the version Windows/Mac/Linux.</p>
<p>This software likes the MySQL WorkBrach, it allows we create a playground without any connection with any DB and then we can play Gremlin and GraphDB inside this playground.</p>
<p>There is always a button can show the graph when you do query, so it is very easy and convenient.</p>
<p>However, we stopped the research, because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we want to connect to DB, it needs Pro version, which means we need to pay, we don't have budget to buy, and we would like to connect Neptune originally not only play win playground feature.</li>
<li>I found after addE, the existing all Nodes will disappear, I'm not sure the bugs, this will increase more resarch time, due to the time limitation, we stopped the research.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Gremlify</h4>
<p>The finall tool is website, don't need to install and it is free, if you don't have requirement to install DB and just want to try, you can use this. -> <a href="https://gremlify.com/">Gremlify</a>，I haven't use it, but I saw our another member showed this, and seems very convenient.</p>
<p>I don't have screenshot can show, this website allows you use mouse to create Node and Edge directly and not need to write query sentence, I think this is more convenient, and it also have visualization graph when you do query.</p>
<p>If anyone use it and feel good, please leave comment to me, thankt you!</p>
<p>Alright, that's all the research note of our cross-team collaboration Innovative Idea Research. This time I collaborate with 1 member from another team and 1 member who is same team with me but neven collaborate before (she is QE, and we run pair programming), and this technology is totally new for us, this is a very good experience for me, so I would like to write it down.</p>
<p>Espicially when collaborating, we know the member from another team will leave company after 1 month, this will be the first time and also final time we have collaboration, we should hold this opptunity to perform well, to do great job and create good memory and present good result in final.</p>
<p>This is my first time to write English article after a long while, I believe my English improved a lot since I'm working in a Indian company located in Taiwan and having American business collaboration teams.</p>
<p>If you like or if there are some question/some errors in this article, please leave comment or send mail to me, thanks :).</p>

14:T1044,<p>I always think, as a software engineer, what's my dream? What's my next target and task?</p>
<p>For me, dream and objectives are the important power for keeping motivation and enthusiasm, if the dream is hard to achieve, and it will be the best point to keep learning and doing.</p>
<p>So as a software engineer, my original intention was not engineer is easy to earn money, is not that I don't have other options, it is because I want to make own products, I want to create things by myself, also playing skills is another reason.</p>
<p>I have always thought if I work for money, what will leave after I work as engineer many years? Will it many programming skills? Will it a lot of money? Will it achievement or skills of management?</p>
<p>Since I was young, I touched many computer things by myself, I felt accomplished while writing code in computer class in junior school. One of my dream was my making a personal website by myself, because I didn't suit to many different blog platforms, I want to edit themes and arragement by myself, this was one reason that I want to be a software engineer.</p>
<p>I didn't aware my real dream before and I have thought a while in this half year then I know that my dream is <strong>Create by myself</strong> and I need to keep learning skills and having implement experience constantly.</p>
<p>After developed the third version of Miri, I feel my technical skills are still immature. I need to have more experience and learn more, so I stopped the development of Miri. After I accumlate more skills, I become more powerful, I will back and design Miri more perfact.</p>
<h1>Chapter 8 - The location of Miri</h1>
<p>Like I referred at the <a href="https://minayu.site/en/2021/08/miri-development-series-2-begin-en/">first story</a>, <code>The main concept</code> of the Miri is very important, I always stood at back-end point to develop Miri, I didn't know that I should stand more higher perspective to plan Miri. I need to think about the product location of Miri, what users want to see? What's balance between ideal (Helping people) and business (Earning money for development and maintenance) and many other things.</p>
<p>Before next time I continue to develop Miri, I need to think about</p>
<ul>
<li>The main concept</li>
<li>Target users and customers</li>
<li>What is the final map</li>
</ul>
<p>Then other questions will accord to these three answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do it need multiple languages?</li>
<li>Do it need to develop app?</li>
<li>How's the interface does Miri need?</li>
<li>What's feature does Miri need?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then design Miri according these questions, implement, .. the job of Back-end and Front-end ...</p>
<h1>Chapter 9 - Future Features</h1>
<p>Although I need to clear the main concept of Miri, but I know some features I definitely hope to do it in the future!</p>
<p>So the following parts I want to do it at future:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop independent front-end (website and app), Separate front-end from Line Bot and Telegram Bot.</li>
<li>Develop Graphical Chart of Astrology chart and Zi Wei</li>
<li>Develop new divination methods</li>
<li>Design and draw divination cards by ownself</li>
<li>Optimize explanation of all divination methods</li>
<li>Research the probability of getting cards</li>
<li>Research the combination explanation and smart explanation</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list is whole features I can imagine currently, others points like <code>How many methods should it have?</code> and <code>What's the UI should it need?</code> and many other questions I still need to think and clarify them.</p>
<p>So make a product my ownself is not easy, that's why many start-up product need to re-make again and again, because there are many different things need to be clarify and considered and no one can know that the currently decisions will be fail or not, we can not know future now.</p>
<p>But If I really want to do, then go, just need to do more consideration as I can.</p>
<p>This series will stop temporarily, I hope there will be next story, we expect it!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, the next article will begin to introduce development skills of Miri.</p>
15:T47c7,<p>Recalling this life period, it seems all things are just happened yesterday, time passed quickly.</p>
<p>The experience of this period gave me big harvest, although I used to doubt my decision, but I insisted to keep it until finish.</p>
<p>In English version, I will not write as long as Chinese version, because writing style are different and some description of different languages are not same, but I still keep important points.</p>
<p>So, that's begin the story in this half year!</p>
<h1>Chapter 4 - Motivated from colleague</h1>
<p><strong>Ahh, I feel if this atmosphere continue, maybe I will quit job next year.</strong></p>
<p>2020 October 16, I smelt that our department might be dismissed, this situation like I faced at first job, everything was gradually stopped, lacked of any direction and supervisor lead us to do some meaningless things.</p>
<p>So future is unpredict, you never know what will happend in next second, next hour, next day or next week.</p>
<p>when I was noticed by my supervisor, he told me it's time to pick a good time and leave.</p>
<p>I discussed a good time with my Human Resources friend, we worked together both in first and second companies.</p>
<p><strong>Sorry, I really don't know this thing, this announcement didn't pass here.</strong></p>
<p>That's ok, I already feel it, when the top and high levels supervisors have been changed many people and many elders retired, I can feel the thing will happend.</p>
<p>When the time of leaving has been checked, I have about 2-3 weeks can enjoy my last days in company. Our company is very near beach, if I quit, I think I will not have many chance to visit the beach.</p>
<p>So at the Saturday, I decided to visit the beach with my designer colleague. We went to a beautiful restaurant, with cool weather and dressed light dress skirt, it represented we put down the huge stress of work.</p>
<p>We talked about things of company, previous days and we discussed the business of <code>Miri</code>. <code>Miri</code> in that moment is a Line social media robot and there was only one easy divination feature, Runes, the user guide was a mess, but the divination feature at least can activate, getting result and imperfact explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Miri is good innovative idea, you should conitnue develop it!</strong></p>
<p>I have already introduced Miri to my designer colleague, she played Miri many times, I never think Miri is funny before, I just thought it was only a divination feature with imperfact code and structure plans.</p>
<p><strong>I suddently recalled, I have a project which has been online for 2 years and being stable, I can show it when chat or interview, it is Miri!</strong></p>
<p>She motivated me, I began to think about continue developing Miri, to continue my dream: make a divination and fortune-telling product.</p>
<p>So, after I quitted job, I decided to give myself half year to develop Miri and release it a new version.</p>
<h1>Chapter 5 - The third version</h1>
<p>In last story, I refered that Miri was in the second version, which only included a divination feature.</p>
<p>The days before I quit job, I have began to plan the next features and decided it will be the third version.</p>
<p>I recalled that I first position Miri as a chat bot, but I needed a specific feature for showing to interviewers, so I developed one divination feature. After it, the position of Miri tend to divination and fortune-telling, thus I decided to change the position of Miri from chat bot to a divination product offically.</p>
<p>I gave myself half year to plan and implement the third version, the following features are the objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactor and Re-design the back-end structure</li>
<li>Extend divination methods since 1 to 6.</li>
<li>Optimize the explanation and description of divination results</li>
<li>Add another platform to use (the original is Line social app)</li>
<li>Account management and different languages</li>
<li>More completed user guide (menu, document, flow)</li>
<li>Optimize divination flow</li>
</ul>
<p>The plan can make Miri more complete than before and this will be the big improvement than the last version.</p>
<p>In third version, because I have learned how to design structure, so I first I redesigned the structure and refactor the code for suit the development of new features.</p>
<p>Then I extended more divination methods for having more choices and more fun. Optimized the explanation of results because the vision arrangement was very bad and there were many wrong words in old explanations. Redesigned the divination flow, made it more fluently for users.</p>
<p>In third version, I considered that I want Miri can be seen for more users except in Taiwan or Asia, so I decided to develop telegram platform and English dialogue which my Russian programmer friend suggested me. I used to compare <code>What's app</code> and <code>Messanger</code>, but <code>Telegram</code> is the last winner, it has similar features with Line bot and it has totally different target customers with Line. However, considered that I want to push Miri to more users, I think I will plan website and mobile apps in the future.</p>
<p>About adding English dialogue, I binded it with back-end side which means I need to design accounts feature for store the user and its language. Because  I used social apps as the front-end part temporarily and I can not add remembering langauge feature inside it.</p>
<p>The last part is user guide and user flow. I considered that the user flow was very bad at last version, users need to type <code>Runes</code> and activated the feature, so I designed better flow than before. Also there was not any user guide and menu, I made them in this time.</p>
<h1>Chapter 6 - Develop product is not easy</h1>
<p>My totally tasks and sequences were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[APIs] Check the brige of front-end and back-end</p>

<p>Making product is more hard than I thought before, I thought I only need to write code and achieve the features, but there were other parts I need to consider not only the code.</p>
<p>The following parts, I begin to describe what kind of problems and obstacles I met and how to solve them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The importance of UI/User Flow</h2>
<p>I believe the experience of this half year bring me a big harvest, not only the skills of back-end. As a back-end engineer, I always stand in the back-end aspect for seeing things, but in this period, I found I can not only stand at it, I should switch my role to UI designer, users and other roles to consider this product.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why need us?</strong></em></p>
<p>Before describe my experience, I want to arise a concept, why company need us? In social value and the scene created by news and reporters, employees are always be the side of selection, so this make all employees need to improve themselves constantly to suit the requirement of companies.</p>
<p>However the work of us is making product from plan to reality and operate it. So every roles in team are important, the critical points should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each role need to maxsize their ability and efficacy which are best suit for product</li>
<li>Communicate and cooperate with team for come up with the best results and solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>So it is not only one's responsibility and it's not the thing about who is powerful or who can insist the extreme method but not suit to team and the development.</p>
<p>After I planned which features I want to develop in the third version, I immediately began to refactor the back-end code, because it was written when I was not mature of back-end, then I want to achieve the features quickly, so I didn't consider more and wrote code quickly everyday.</p>
<p>Untill one day, I opened client side (Line or Telegram) and I want to test features I completed, I found that I only can use few features and reply less messages, even there are many features have done in back-end.</p>
<p>I confused, I changed code while testing on client step by step, and I realized that I can not continue this. Thus I know I need to switch my role from back-end to user or UI designer, I need to know what kind of effects I want to see at front-end and what is the flow, as a user, then switch to UI designer to plan the user flow and story according requirements.</p>
<p><strong>I realized that every roles in software development are important.</strong></p>
<p>Without UI designers or the roles who plan or design the projects, even we are the programmer, we have skills can make the plan to reality, but we don't have direction and objectives, even we complete features but it might not be integrated with back-end and front-end, it might not be confirm to the requirements of users or customers.</p>
<p>This is what I learned in this experience, after the confused period, I swich myself to user and designer, draw the flow and imagination actions on paper then saw the draw to plan how to do it by code. I developed Miri more fluent.</p>
<p>This concept maybe seems very easy, but to be honest, as backend engineer for long while, my aspect limit in back-end gradually, so my thinking and my consideration will put back-end at the first.</p>
<p><strong>Before make a plan to reality, switch to user role, think about what kind of features want to see, then going to design the user flow and interface, the final is programmers implement features according to requirements</strong></p>
<h2>The integration of different front-end platform</h2>
<p>Adding Telegram platform is the new in the third version, Line is the original front-end platform, now Miri has been designed for providing two platforms. Since before to now, I only have experience of processing one platform, it is front-end website, so every featues of back-end and APIs only need to be designed for the only front-end page, the task of 2 platforms will be the new challenge.</p>
<p>The features perform in Line and Telegram are a little different, for example a special message type called <code>Template message</code> exist in Line, but not be provided from Telegram. I want to have same user experience in both platform, so I planned:</p>
<ul>
<li>As UI role, I designed two platforms message present can be same as possible.</li>
<li>As Back-end, I designed the structure for suit multiple message type objects and increased flexibility of message composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>So that's see how to realize.</p>
<p><em><strong>Line的Template Message</strong></em></p>
<p>This is <strong><a href="https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/messaging-api/message-types/#buttons-template">Buttons Template Message Type</a></strong> in Line, it is one message which contains photo, title, short description and button, but not be provided by Telegram.</p>
<p><em><strong>Desgined similar message type in Telegram, refered from Line</strong></em></p>
<p>In Telegram, my solution is composing photo, text and button (which called <strong><a href="https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/telegram.inlinekeyboardbutton.html">InlineKeyboardButton</a></strong> in Telegram) to present the feature similar to Line template message.</p>
<p>There are more these design, I will describe them in later articles.</p>
<h2>The balance of skills and user usage</h2>
<p>It is like as programmers, we want to use the newest and cool skills to do back-end side, but sometimes it's not requests from users.</p>
<p>When I developed Miri, I always thought I have done many features and code in back-end, but they can not present totally in front-end, this made me confused. When I was in my past work life, the back-end always be complicated and be vast, but present in front-end page very less.</p>
<p>So it means any solutions can achieve projects, but need to according the time spending, the cooperation with front-end, UI design, requirement from users and other conditions. Instead of pursuing the extreme or newest skills.</p>
<p>As back-end, we all know the construction of back-end is vast, maybe it can not be present totally at front-end, but every back-end need to know how much efforts they spend.</p>
<h2>Operation and Maintenance</h2>
<p>I underestimated the operation part. In whole development, I tested Miri by hosted on localhost, so it was totally impeccable at local environment. I finished all features and tested all tests, then I decided to deploy Miri on Heroku server. It happend many things, delayed the time I set originally.</p>
<p>The first is the environment and package dependency on Heroku, the last deployment was 2 years ago, the version of heroku was very old, I have to delete it and create another new engine for deployment. Another problem I faced is dependency, the specific heroku version limit the version of Python and Packages, so I have to change the python version I used in Miri and changed the package version. It was good, after I changed versions, it still suit Miri, it didn't happend any big problems.</p>
<p>The critical point is that I didn't notice the free plan of heroku will restart the server and re-deploy the project every day which cause cache or variable data will be delete or miss.</p>
<p>The original design of accounts management was store user data in SQLite, which puts with other code and will be deleted by server re-starting every day, so I need to come up with other solution for store accounts data in other side.</p>
<p>This costed me much time to debug and fix because I didn't have any ideas why data will be deleted on server and be saved on localhost, I was sure the code on server and local are same. So the problem is server-side, I took some solutions at first time, but didn't solve it, I observed for almost 2 weeks which delayed the schedule and I finally found the information on heruku page and took many methods to test the bug, got the root problem.</p>
<p>If I have more knowledge of operation or I can test Miri on server more early, I think these problems can be found more early and I can design Miri more perfact. At the first time I changed code many times but after I found the root problem, then I know those changes were in vain.</p>
<p><strong>When problems can not be solved immediately, don't be nervous, it is because you don't understand it, give yourself more time to observe and research.</strong></p>
<h2>The lack of programming skills</h2>
<p>When I was in last company, I used Redis and dictionary type to store cache or temporary data.</p>
<p>I wanted to use dictionary to store accounts data for getting default language of user quickly and reducing the usage of database. However, I don't know why I store data in dictionary and the data will be changed constantly on heroku server (on local is success), and it is unstable if any user change their default language.</p>
<p>The origin is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
{
    "Sam": "EN",
    "Jerry": "JP"
}
</code></pre>
<p>But after Sam changed his default langauge, the dictioanry should be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-py">
{
    "Sam": "CN",
    "Jerry": "JP"
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, it change constantly, in this time, it is "CN", but in next time, it will be "EN" and constantly change.</p>
<p>I haven't gotten any root problem even now, this is because I haven't enough familiar with my programming skills, there are always some small but critical details need to be awared.</p>
<p>I believe that use Redis and dictionary to store temporary data is good solution to reducing the utilization of performance but I can not achieve it this time, I need to improve my skills.</p>
<h1>Chapter 7 - The confused feeling before success</h1>
<p>Final chapter in this article, the psychology problems always be hard to human. In the progress of development, I used to doubt myself.</p>
<p><strong>Is it worth? should I need to continue? Or I should stop it and find a job...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why I have written many back-end code and they can not present by front-end totally? What interviewers will think? What other people will think? Will they think I'm a loser?</strong></p>
<p>I doubted myself many times in this road, especially near the success, only need to insist a while.</p>
<p>This affected me a lot, because this is my dream, only I know everything, nobody knows this will be good or not, so I need to have powerful inside heart to keep it go ahead. (I didn't have much confidence before)</p>
<p>If other people doubted myself, I followed them to doubt myself too, sometimes it affected me and shaked my insistance.</p>
<p>What supported me and insisted me?</p>
<p><strong>I tell myself, don't think too much, I have many tasks in my TODO list, they all need to be completed, I only need to think how to complete tasks, not doubt them.</strong></p>
<p>Finally I completed Miri and I am writing the stories of Miri now. When face any challenges, obstacles and problems, sometimes we will be confused and afraid of it, but I learned those fears are imagined by ourselves, the only solution is beginning to do it and keeping do it until finish.</p>
16:T3b35,<p>I wrote the story of how Miri was conceived in the Github README originally.</p>
<p>But when I recently completed the development of the third version and was about to rewrite the README, I found that I should move the description here, plus I want to record my motivation and story of making Miri.</p>
<p>Due to I am a person who easily forgets the past, I hope to record stories of Miri development through blog articles. Whether I succeed in the future or not, it will be an interesting story.</p>
<h1>Chapter 1 - The Birth of Miri</h1>
<p><img src="https://mingjungyu.files.wordpress.com/2021/08/599743_544968448866799_1105772966_n.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><code>Miri Robot Fortune Teller</code> - Miri is a fictitious 10-year-old girl with a character set like she was gifted and intelligent since childhood, and interest in mathematics and numerology. She help questioners who are confused get the results and suggestion.</p>
<p>In fact, Miri was not intended to be a robot fortune-teller at the beginning. I originally hoped to develop Miri in the direction of artificial intelligence as a management, assistant or housekeeper.</p>
<p>Before studying in graduate school, I lost my goal in life and felt very confused for the future. During that time I had time to watch some movies and dramas, so I watched <code>Iron Man</code> and <code>Resident Evil</code>. I saw that there was <code>Friday</code> artificial intelligence in the Iron Man movie as assistant, following Stark's instructions, Friday was able to collect data, analyze data and display it by fictitious visual interface in the third dimension space, Friday always help Stark manage some things or report progress. In Resident Evil, the artificial intelligence "Red Queen" that appeared in the first episode also aroused my enthusiasm. The Red Queen helped control the entire company and later developed self-aware artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Affected by the Iron Man's <code>Friday</code> and the <code>Resident Evil "Red Queen"</code>, I was inspired to artificial intelligence, hoping to study artificial intelligence or enter the powerful development research room in the future, work with great engineers from all over the world develop artificial intelligence together.</p>
<p><code>Artificial intelligence</code> sounds like a super cool technological term. I touched <a href="https://www.rinna.jp/">りんな</a> when I was in the master degree, <code>りんな</code> is artificial intelligence made by a Japanese company, connects with Line social media, so I can chat with her on Line, and there are some interesting features can be used. I felt surprised because I thought my dream is to create another <code>りんな</code>.</p>
<p>I firstly decided to set the dream of artificial intelligence towards the chat robot, and chosen Line bot api as the first step of my artificial intelligence dream. (Now go to the official website of <code>りんな</code> and the company has developed many different new functions, and they developed feature of divination!</p>
<p>Divination and numerology are really a novel market. I feel that if I don’t start planning the implementation, there will be many people occupy the market)</p>
<p>However, when I was in master degree, my programming skills had just started. I had no experience in software development at all, and I had no relevant knowledge, so I didn’t know how to start.</p>
<p>Finally, there was an opportunity. Our university department requested a teacher to teach how to implement Line chat robots with only one class time, which gave me a chance to step into the development of chat robots, who didn't know how to start at the time. It was at this time that the Line account of <code>Miri</code> was created.</p>
<p><code>Miri</code> is born!</p>
<p>Why is it called <code>Miri</code>?</p>
<p>Because at the time, only Apple’s <code>Siri</code> was like a personal assistant with artificial intelligence technology, and I created this chatbot with the original intention because I wanted to make artificial intelligence. I added the abbreviation of my name <code>M</code> to <code>Siri</code> formed <code>Miri</code> as the name of my artificial intelligence assistant.</p>
<p>How did the avatar of <code>Miri</code> come from?</p>
<p>In 2010, Facebook had an external plug-in software that could make a portrait picture by myself. I made a cute picture similar to myself according to my appearance at the time and put it on Facebook.</p>
<p>Later, I thought that photo looked like a young girl, and <code>Miri</code> sounded like a cute girl's name, so I decided to put the photo as avatar of Miri.</p>
<p>When Miri was first born, most of the time was in shutdown state. As mentioned above, the teacher who taught the Line chatbot only spent one class for teaching the implementation, plus my programming ability was just started. The basic abilities are completely 0, so the initial Miri feature only received messages from users and send same messages back to users, like Echo.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to set up a server, if I didn't excute program on my computer, Miri was in shutdown state and did not react at all.</p>
<p>At that time, I only registered Line account of Miri and used Line bot api code provided by the teacher and I used Ngrok to connect localhost. Only a very simple program was built, and even didn't understand the Line bot api program.</p>
<h1>Chapter 2 - Miri Basic Development</h1>
<p>Since most of the projects I implemented in master degree are related to website front-end pages, and there was a serious lack of back-end knowledge, so I had no idea that after I created Miri, How do I continue to develop her? How do I make her become an artificial intelligence assistant like <code>Friday</code> and the <code>Red Queen</code>? The development of Miri has been temporarily stopped. It has been suspended for 1-2 years without planning any development.</p>
<p>After graduation, in order to achieve my dream of developing artificial intelligence, fortunately, I entered the American startup company that develops artificial intelligence. During that time, I improved my python programming ability a lot and learning a lot of artificial intelligence knowledge.</p>
<p>After half a year of training in a high-pressure environment, I found that I have more background and technical skills than before to support me to continue to develop Miri.</p>
<p>So, I restarted Miri, which has been stopped for 2 years, and then tried to use the knowledge and technology I learned to plan Miri's first version program architecture, and add artificial intelligence sentense analysis packages <code>nltk</code> and <code>jieba</code> to implement simple feature of receiving messages and  reply the sentences which have been setted by coming messages.</p>
<p>The technoligies I used are flask structure, nltk, jieba and understood basic implement of line bot api.
And the response message was initially set up some greeting terms like <code>Good morning</code>, <code>Good night</code> and other basic terms. Of course, I also thought about making Miri to a lover chat robot, so I also set up a few flirting sentences, such as <code>Like you</code>, <code>Love you</code>, you are so beautiful... etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>So the first version only have chinese reply sentences, basically there were some basic sentences like "good morning", "hi"</strong></em></p>
<p>Also because after understanding the operating principle behind artificial intelligence, I found that artificial intelligence is not as dreamy as I imagined at the beginning. Most of them rely on a large number of input sentence content, or training vocabulary and store it in the database, and reply messages which are setted with each word.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also possible that I have not explored deeper or core artificial intelligence knowledge, so my understanding of artificial intelligence implementation only stops at this.</p>
<p>So the only method of training Miri is inputing amount of sentences and cutting into words by <code>nltk</code> 或 <code>jieba</code>, then setting the features/ reply messages for each word.</p>
<p>If I want to develop Miri as personal assistant, there will need to connect extended features, like notes app, weather app or other features.</p>
<p>Developing artificial intelligence to personal assistant like in movies, there must need teamworks of a lot of reseachers, scientists, programmers. Rely on 1 person team is not possible, in addition even the current technoligy of artificial intelligence is not familir.</p>
<p>Hmm.. so just watch movies and have fun, those cool technology still need a long road to achieve. Although for artificial intelligence, I already don't have much enthusiasm than before, but created <code>Miri</code> also opened the road of software development by myself.</p>
<p>Although want to develop Miri to chat bot or personal assistant, but I thought Miri lack of a main subject product concept.</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of chat bot?</li>
<li>What kind of features does she has?</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't have any idea, I wanted to make Miri like a virtual lover, also wanted to make as assistant like Friday, this time it seems I pick needle in sea, lack of main concept, can not imagine the final state of Miri and can not have plans of development and implement.</p>
<h1>Chapter 3 - Towards To Divination And Numerology</h1>
<p>On Aug 15, 2019, I left my first job. I have to prepare for the second job interview. I have a period of time to prepare the resume and side-projects. Because I already have software development experience and technical abilities, so I adjusted the code of the previous programs and were uploaded to github, I also deployed some projects on the heroku server, and put them in resume.</p>
<p>Due to my first job was in a start-up company, the company’s product development process was very turbulent, lacking major directions and major product owners, and the product had to be re-planned and reworked time and time again. I have participated in many web projects and main product of company, but there is no project or product are online that can be shown to future interviewers.</p>
<p>At this time, I thought that I can continue develop Miri, I hoped I can use all the technologies and skills I learned in my first job to Miri, and Miri can represent collection of skills and experience learned in the first job.</p>
<p>I didn't arrange a lot of time to develop Miri, I only gave myself 1-2 months to develop Miri, and then I was ready to find the next job.</p>
<p>I must to complete a version of phased results in two months, so it can not like <code>chat bot</code> which has opened and widely concepts. I must make a main concept and limit scope. And in same time, I need to use some new abilities which I learned and been trained at first job, not some sentences which were setted.</p>
<p>After I took long term consideration, driven by my persinality, I don't want Miri to be normal chatbot, I decided to make some unique and novel concepts. I recalled that I learned Runes (one divination) in my leisure time, it is an unique and mysterious concept, I had confident to achieve the phased results in 2 months, it is enough to show to the next interviewer.</p>
<p>Thus, I decided to extend development based on original design on Line bot api, making a new unique feature (runes divination), adding new Line api message type <code>Template</code> for guiding users to do divination. Using SQLite to store static runes data and explanation, then reply to users when they click button.</p>
<p>I refered program structure design which I observed at first job, simple designed strucutre which can extend divination feature and keeping the originally basic conversation.</p>
<p><em><strong>So this version only have chinese language too, basically there was new template message type for guiding users and its content is runes.</strong></em></p>
<p>I totally spent only three weeks and complete the target, this is the second version of Miri.</p>
<p>Then learned how to build it on heroku server, so that Miri was officially online and users can play it.</p>
<p>Although there was simple runes divination, but it was enough that I can raise it to interviewers when I was in interviews and even I can show it to my colleagues. My friends and colleagues sometimes played Miri.</p>
<p>This is the development story of Miri, which moment was setted at an artificial intelligence and turned into divination robot then being to robot fortune-teller.</p>
<p>The above is the story for me from the first steps of ​​Miri, until I started to implement it, and then decided the concept.</p>
<p>Now I recalled I never thought Miri is important to me. But I always want to develop her while every time I learned new skills or quitting jobs. I always want to develop Miri by all skills I learned. Developing let me understand what abilities and skills I lacked, what I need to learn can continue develop Miri.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because I have worked 2 years and in 2 different company, but still don't have any projects and products online. Suddenly found Miri has online and operating 2 years stably and I can show to people any time.</p>
<p>I lacked enough abilities to develop Miri to the final state in my heart. In this time I quitted job, I developed Miri for 6 months because inspiration from my ex-collegues, now Miri is important to me now.</p>
<p>These experience will be write at next article.</p>
<p>While I am writing this article, I compared <code>Miri</code> and <code>りんな</code>. I understood some important concepts.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing is clear the definition of product:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is main concept?</li>
<li>Target users/ customers</li>
<li>How widely scope want to implement?</li>
</ul>
<p>Before making product, it is necessaru that check these things though these questions, because the results will decide it need how many team members, what skills it need, which area, region need to market, and many many other things.</p>
<p>As a developer since first job, I only observe the implement aspects and stayed at the basic positions. I understood many concepts while I began to develop Miri widely at this time for 6 months, I found that I always used the developer/programmer aspect to think about things.</p>
<p>It is not suit to consider the whole aspect of product.</p>
<p>Developing Miri alone bring me:</p>
<ul>
<li>What skills/abilities I lack now</li>
<li>What skills/abilities I need to learn next</li>
<li>How one product make and operation, design, program, marketing</li>
<li>How important to main concept and limited scope of one product</li>
<li>Change thinking perspective between different characters (sometimes designer, sometimes programer, sometimes being PM and sometimes being Product Owner, think about target customers and how to market it.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And many different things.</p>
<p>I enjoy it and I'm very happy I spent 6 months to develop Miri and understaning many things.</p>
<p>So about story of these, please expect next article :)</p>
17:T1740,<p><code>Cuando podemos volver a casa?</code></p>
<p><code>Aqui no es mi casa, no me siento comodo aqui y me siento mi familia no estan comodos también</code></p>
<p><code>Todos cambiaron...</code></p>
<p>El primero articulo es aqui: <a href="/2020/02/somos-familia-nuestra-historia-1/">SOMOS FAMILIA - UNA CHICA ASIÁTICA CONTACTA CON LA CULTURA ESPAÑOLA (1)</a></p>
<p>Desde el ultimo vez yo escribé el primero articulo, hemos cambinando mucho.</p>
<p>pasamos por muchas cosas juntos y pero todavia estamos en un grupo y quedamos juntos ahora.</p>
<p>Aunque soy una chica asiática y estoy aprendiendo español y hablo español mal jaja, a veces yo usare los tiempo gramatico incorrecto, entonces ellos no me entienden, pero todavia tienen paciencias a mi.</p>
<p>Ellos llamarme <code>Marina</code>, cuando nos encontramos, siempre saludan con entusiasmo. <code>Hola, Marina, que tal estas? bien?</code>, y después seguimos hablar otras temas.</p>
<h3>ETAPA 4 - LA VIDA EN ESP</h3>
<p>ESP es nombre de nuestra familia, solo tenemos 20-30 personas, es una alianza muy pequeña pero cada persona es muy buena, ayudarse unos a otros y quedamos juntos para hablar la vida.</p>
<p>El jefe de familia es una buena persona, se llama <code>D</code>, siempre tiene paciencia para enseñar español a mi. Todavia el es una persona tan curiosidad jaja. Otras tres personas a su lado son diplomáticos, son responsables de ayudar al jefe y las cosas de diplomáticos y cuidar a la familia. se llaman: <code>J</code>, <code>R</code> y <code>K</code>.</p>
<p>Me gusta aqui y yo siempre ayudarlos para cuidar a la familia, aunque esataba con poco poder en eso tiempo (en el juego, cada persona tiene su numero de poder, quien tiene alto poder es fuerte.).</p>
<p>En ESP, me siento como quedo en casa, estaba muy comoda y contenta, siempre abría juego y hablaba con mi familia, parece volvia a casa.</p>
<p>En eso tiempo, siempre nos atacaban por enemigos rusos jaja y siempre estsbamos enfadados y esperamos poder vengarse en el futuro, entonces seguimos crecer poder mas rapido.</p>
<p>Despues menos dias, ellos me agregan a un grupo de whatsapp. En le primero tiempo, tuve miedo para conocerlos, porque nomalmente taiwanes somos timidas, especialmente Taiwanesas (chicas).</p>
<p>Si sois demasiado entusiastas, nos sentiremos asustados. Si, son culturas diferentes, pero nos adaptaremos lentamente y necesitamos mas tiempo.</p>
<p>Despues entré grupo de whatsapp, yo no entiendo todos mensajes que ellos escribiron. Somos en paises diferentes, entonces tenemos horarios diferentes, cuando yo duermo, ellos depiertan y cuando yo quedo despierta, ellos duermen.</p>
<p>Cada vez yo estaba durmiendo, yo vi muchos mensajes en grupo, quiero entenderlos, entonces usaba google y ver cada mensaje en grupo ellos excribiron cuando yo acabo despierta.</p>
<p>Es dificil para mi, porque siempre yo traducirlos y no puedo entenderlos mensajes. A veces yo usaba google para escribir algunas frases de español en grupo, intenté unirse las temas.</p>
<p>Pero todavia escribí esas flases y palabras en mi libros y aprenderlos. Hasta que ahora, puedo entender muchas flases y responderlos.</p>
<p><code>R</code> es Venezolano, la sola persona puede entender ingles, el me ayudó muchas cosas y cuando yo no entendí las temas o las frases, yo lo pregunté. En el primero, yo no estaba bien de hablar español, siempre hablaba ingles con el. El me enseñó gramatica y parabras.</p>
<p><code>D</code> es el jefe de familia y es mi profesor de español hasta ahora, queremos aprender idiomas y apredemos juntos. yo olvidé que cuando estuvimos en videollamada primera, casi no entiendo que el habló y no puede hablar ingles, solo podemos tener paciente, hablamos muy lentos y traducimos en goole.</p>
<p>Ahora creo que es increible jaja, ..</p>
<p>Otra cosa, yo los mandé las fotos de japones y fuegos artificiales Taiwánes. Despues un rato, yo era diplomático porque juego mucho y puedo hablar ingles y ayudar compañeros.</p>
<p>Todos estaban muy bien hasta que algunas cosas pasan.</p>
<h3>ETAPA 5 - Atacar, Batalla, Mover a otro sitio</h3>
<p>Porque somos alianza pequeña en el juego, hay muchas personas de alianzas grande fueron a atacarnos, aunque tenemos la relacion como una familia pero no se olvida que es un juego guerra, entonces hay muchas emociones como triste y enfadados</p>
<p>Hay muchas personas fuertes nos atacaron y algunas dejaron a la alianza y quien en grupo de Whatsapp son buenas personas como una familia, hablemos sobre la vida de cada compañero todos los dias y hablamos que como crecemos y venganzas.</p>
<p>Un dia, el jefe decidido que movimos a otro sitio donde es lejo de centro de mapa y podemos crecer tranquilos y dejamos los ataques.</p>
<p>Aunque movimos a otro sitio, pero todavia hay personas nos encontreron y seguieron nos atacaron...</p>
<p>En el final, no se que opcion de quien, fuimos a otra alianza muy grande y crecemos el poder para estar mas fuertes.</p>
<p>Pero nuestra relacion estuvimos cambiando mucho...</p>
<h3>las culturas diferentes</h3>
<p>Soy una chica Taiwanesa, cada persona de España o de Sudamerica son muy entusiasmos, cada vez yo abré juego o escribí en Whatsapp, ellos me mandaron muchos corazones y besos jajaja, pero en Taiwan solo amor y quien quiere otra persona (amor) mandar corazones y besos. Aqui si un hombre mandar besos a otra chica, la chica pensará que el hombre la quiere jaja.</p>
<p>Otras cosas sobre culturas diferentes ya olvidé mucho, si recuerdo, yo escribirlos en la proxima articulo!!</p>
<p>En la proxima articulo, hablaré la vida en la alianza grande y que pasó con nuestra relacion.</p>
<p><em><strong>Yo estoy teniendo una relacion con novio español desde Mayo y mantnerlo muy serio, pero es primero tener novio extranjero y espero podemos tener la relacion estable para largo tiempo, si teneis problems con chicas Asiaticas, podeis pregumtarme.</strong></em></p>
18:T12b1,<p>Espera,</p>
<p>Déjame pensar cómo escribir esta historia..</p>
<p>Hola todos y todas,</p>
<p>Me llamo Ming, una chica vivo en Asia de Taiwan.</p>
<p>Me gusta escribir historia y novela por chino, estoy aprendiendo española recientemente y yo pasé algunas cosas que muy sorpresa, entonces quiero escribir en mi blog.</p>
<h2>Etapa 1 - presentarme</h2>
<p>Me gusta aprender idiomas, he aprendido inglés, japonés, español y ruso. Aprendí español desde 2015, porque quiero tener un viaje en sudamerica con mi familia.</p>
<p>No estudié mucho porque no me gustaba español mucho en 2015 años. Pero lo he aprendido en la escuela durante 1.5 años.</p>
<p>Tengo un sueño es usar otro idioma para escribir un artículo. Aunque yo he aprendido inglés, japonés, pero no usar ellos para escribir. Entonces, yo decido desafiar por escribir artículos por español, si escribo mal o incorrecto, puedes dimelo.</p>
<p>yo vivo en Taiwan, donde hablar chino y muy lejo para paises donde hablar español. Pensé que nunca volvería a usar español, en Taiwán, no hay posibilidad de usar español.</p>
<p>En esta serie de artículos, documentaré este viaje de chica asiática y la cultura española.</p>
<h2>Etapa 2 - Cómo comienza esto?</h2>
<p>Recuerdo el recuerdo, todavía me siento tan sorprendido ahora, en noviembre de 2019, yo he empezado a aprender el idioma ruso (Sí, Ruso idioma, tu no leídas mal).</p>
<p>En ese momento, me sentí mal en mi relación con mi ex-novio, necesito hacer otros cosas para cambiar la atención. Entonces yo empecé a aprender ruso y yo recordé que había un tipo de juego móvil que es bueno para aprender el idioma en 2016. Así que busqué el mismo tipo de juego y lo intento...</p>
<p>Me doy un nombre ruso y muy rapido, hay personas me invitan por una rusa alianza. Pero, tal vez ruso es muy dificil o yo empecé a aprender, puedo solo usar google tradutar y no se que escribo correcto o incorrecto.</p>
<p>Me tomo mucho tiempo escribir un mensaje, tengo estres mucho, pero hablo en serio para hablar con alianza, y también le dije a gente de alianza que recién comencé a aprender ruso. Solo me quedé 4 dias, ellos expulsarme y dejarme la alianza. Aunque este es un juego, pero yo estaba muy triste, no sé si debería seguir aprendiendo ruso o no.</p>
<p>Supuse que la razón es que les digo que <code>aprendi</code> ruso (<code>Я учу русский</code>) y <code>учу</code> es el mismo medio para <code>enseñar</code>. Tal vez ellos creen yo soy un professor para enseñar ruso.</p>
<p>En mismo tiempo, yo no puedo sentir amor con mi ex-novio, después de que sucedieron una serie de cosas, estuve tranquila por un tiempo y repensar lo que quiero.</p>
<p>Estaba pensando que tal vez necesito encontrar una alianza que hable inglés, eso es fácil para mí o tal vez intento otro rusa alianza?</p>
<p>En este momento, yo intento para aprender inglés, español y ruso en mismo tiempo. Pero yo pasó la mayor parte del tiempo para aprendi ruso, aunque quiero aprender español para continuar, pero me falta pasión y dije que no hay ninguna oportunidad de usar.</p>
<p>Después dos dias, yo abrí juego y miré la lista de alianza. No hay alianza rusa invítame y porque soy nuevo, no puedo aplicar la alianza rusa top 2.</p>
<p><code>No quiero rendirme e ir a la alianza inglesa, aunque puede ser más fácil para mí</code></p>
<p>Ya vi que una alianza española me invitó, decidi intentar entorno español, comencé mi viaje con la cultura española.</p>
<h2>Etapa 3 - Somos familia</h2>
<p>Tenía miedo porque expulsarme en la alianza anterior y cuando acabo de enter a esta alianza, porque la zona horaria de mi país es diferente del otro país y el idioma acaba de comenzar a aprender</p>
<p><code>Estaba asustado siempre y expulsarme nuevamente</code></p>
<p>Entonces juego el juego más en serio y participo activamente en la conversación, mi aliados me trata muy bien y parece tolerante que acabo de aprender español.</p>
<p>Por que yo escribo <code>parece</code> ? Porque cuando entré en la alianza rusa anterior, ellos me trata bien, pero expulsarme luego.</p>
<p>Tengo miedo en cualquier momento, pero todavía me dicen que <code>somos familia</code>, una y otra vez.</p>
<p><em><strong>Somos Familia</strong></em></p>
<p>Muchas gracias, yo busco una familia para quedarse, me gusta esta familia, esta alianza poco a poco.</p>
<p>Aunque esto es muy diferente a mi cultura y esto es solo un juego, no sé si es real o no. Entonces voy a observar..</p>
<p>Me gusta esta familia ahora, nos hemos enfrentado a muchas cosas y todavía estamos juntos ahora.</p>
<p>Escribiré más historia en el próximo artículo, gracias por mirar.</p>
<p>Ya combre mas libros y estoy esforzandome para aprender español.</p>
